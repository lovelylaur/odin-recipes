                <li>Thyme</li>
                <li>Salt and ground pepper</li>
                <li>Butternut squash</li>
                <li>Shell pasta</li>
                <li>Vegetable stock</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large pot. Add sage leaves and fry for a few seconds until it crisps up. Immediately remove crisped sage leaves from the butter and keep aside until used.</li>
                <li>Saute onions and minced garlic in butter until onions turn soft and garlic releases its fragrance. Do NOT brown onion or garlic. Cook until just translucent.</li>
                <li>Add thyme sprigs, salt, and fresh ground pepper to taste to the pot. Give it a mix.</li>
                <li>Roast diced butternut squash along with onion-garlic and seasoning for a few minutes. This will help the squash caramelize slightly by roasting in butter.</li>
                <li>Pour the vegetable stock and milk. Stir and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat, cover, and cook until squash is tender. About 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>While butternut squash is cooking in a large pot cook pasta in salted boiling water according to packet instructions until al-dente. Don't overcook pasta.</li>
                <li>Time it accordingly. Add pasta to boiling water and just when butternut squash sauce is ready. Reserve 1 to 2 cups of pasta-cooked starchy water.</li>
                <li>Wait until squash is cooked fork tender. Remove sage stems from the pot and blitz using an immersion blender until the squash turns smooth. </li>
                <li>Turn off heat, add in grated cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted.</li>
                <li>Add cooked pasta shells into the butternut squash sauce. Gently mix it until the pasta is coated in sauce.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately warm topped with crispy sage leaves, a sprinkle of ground pepper, and a little grated cheese.</li>
            </ol>
